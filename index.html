        <h1>What is Git</h1>
        <p>Git is a version control system  that manages and keeps track of your code</p>
        <p>Git was developed in 2005 by <b>Linus Torvalds</b> as open source software for tracking changes in a distributed version control system</p>
        <p>Git is typically used by Software engineers.Git as a tool can be used to track changes in code and collaborate with other developers.</p>
         <div>
            <p>Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter.</p>
            <h3>
                Other examples of version control systems include
                <ul>
                    <li>Mercurial</li>
                    <li>Bitbucket</li>

        <h1>Installing Git</h1>
        <h3>How To Install Git on Windows</h3>
        <p>Intalling Git on Windows is a fairly straightforward process and it involves the following steps</p>
           <ol>
               <li>Download the Git for Windows</li>
               <li>Run the installer</li>
               <li>Verify installation</li>
           </ol>

         <h4><b>Step 1:</b> Download the windows installer</h4>
            <p>Go to the Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">official website</a> and download the latest version of Git for Windows</p>
            <img src="assets/download.png" alt="Git download">
            <p>Click on the download link to download the Git installer</p>
        <h4><b>Step 2:</b>Run the install and select options</h4>
            <p>Run the installer and follow the steps in the installation wizard</p>
            <img src="assets/run.png" alt="Git install">
            <p>Click on the next button to proceed with the installation</p>
            <p>The installer will request an installation location.Keep the default unless you need to change it , and click Next</p>
            <img src="assets/install.png" alt="Git location">
            <p>A component selection screen will be displayed.Keep the default settings unless you need to modify them , and click next</p>
            <img src="assets/components.png" alt="Git components">
            <p>You will be prompted to create a start folder.Leave it as is and click <b>Next</b></p>
            <img src="assets/next.png" alt="Git start">
            <p>Choose the default editor used by Git and click <b>Next</b></p>
            <p>In this next step, you can opt to rename your initial branch. The default is master. </p>
            <p>Now you’re on to modifying the PATH environment. Leave this on the recommended selection, Git from the command line and also from 3rd party software and click Next.</p>
            <p>On the next screen, you need to pick the SSH program you want to use. Git does come with its own SSH client, so leaving the default settings checked is fine. Click Next</p>
            <p>The following option concerns server certificates. The majority of users should choose the default, Use the OpenSSL library. Click Next.</p>
            <p>The next screen deals with line ending conversions. Leave it set to the default option, Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings. Changing this option might cause issues. Click Next</p>
            <p>Next up, you’ll need to select the terminal emulator. The default MinTTY is recommended. Click Next.</p>
            <p>On the next screen, you’ll be asked what the git pull command should do. Again, the default option is recommended. Click Next.</p>
